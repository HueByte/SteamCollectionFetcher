# What is it?
Scrapper made for Project Zomboid mod list automatization

# How it works?
- Save your workshop mod collection as HTML (ctrl + s in the browser)
- Provide the path for downloaded HTML file
- Enter the collection ID

Scrapper will extract all workshop items IDs and then combine them into single string.
Then it will from all found mod links extract their Mod Ids

# Requirements (no release as for now) 
- .NET SDK
